PART 2:

Making this repository public now. It's been a long time since I don't check this project. This is the second of my first projects on my way of learning. A lot of bad practices and some thing I didn't did and should have; experiences that made me better and learn by the bad ways that clean and readable code is a most be rather than I'll fix it later.

Supabase as a backend, this projects helped me a lot in my improvement, it was my first hard hit in my programming career(a necessary ill).

PS: A frined started with me, but he didn't last more than a week, thats why some stuffs are in spanish and i'll left it just like that cause that's part of the history
